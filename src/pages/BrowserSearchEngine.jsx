		<h1>Understanding Search Engines</h1>
		<p>
			A search engine is a tool that helps you find specific information on the web by typing in keywords or questions. Common search engines include Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, you open a browser (like Chrome) and use a search engine (like Google) inside the browser to search for information. In short, the browser is the tool for navigating the web, and the search engine helps you find things on the web.
