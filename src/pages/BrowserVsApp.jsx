		<h1>Browser vs. Software Applications</h1>
		<p>
			A browser is a specific type of software application, but not all software applications are browsers. Hereâ€™s the difference:
		</p>
		<h2>Browser:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Designed to access and display web pages from the internet.</li>
			<li><strong>Function:</strong> Allows you to navigate websites, use web-based applications, and interact with online content.</li>
			<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Software Application:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Any program or set of programs designed for end-users to perform specific tasks on a computer.</li>
			<li><strong>Function:</strong> Can serve a wide range of functions beyond web browsing, including productivity, design, communication, and more.</li>
			<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Microsoft Word (word processing), Adobe Photoshop (photo editing), Zoom (video conferencing), and browsers themselves.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In summary, a browser is a type of software application specifically for navigating the web, whereas software applications encompass a broad range of programs for various tasks.
