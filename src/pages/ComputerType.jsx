		<h1>To determine what kind of computer you&apos;re using, you can look at several factors</h1>
		<p>Congratulations on your new computer! Here&apos;s what you can do to get started:</p>
		<p>
			Operating System: Check if you&apos;re using Windows, macOS, Linux, or another operating system. This information is usually displayed on the desktop or in system settings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Physical Design: Laptops and desktops have distinct designs. Laptops are portable and have built-in displays, while desktops typically have separate monitors and larger CPU towers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Branding: Look for any logos or branding on the device itself. For example, if you see an Apple logo, you&apos;re likely using a Mac computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			System Information: You can also find detailed information about your computer&apos;s specifications, including the manufacturer and model, in the system settings or by using system information tools.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you gather this information, you&apos;ll have a better understanding of the type of computer you&apos;re using.
