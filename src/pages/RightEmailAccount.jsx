		<h1>How to Verify Your Email Account</h1>
		<p>To verify you&apos;re using the correct email account, follow these steps:</p>

		<h2>1. Check the Email Address:</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Look at the Email Address:</strong> Make sure it matches your official student email address or the email account you intended to use. This is usually visible in the email app or web interface.
		</p>

		<h2>2. Verify Account Information:</h2>

			<strong>Account Settings:</strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Windows Mail:</strong> Go to Settings &gt; Manage Accounts and check the account details.</li>
			<li><strong>macOS Mail:</strong> Go to Mail &gt; Preferences &gt; Accounts and review the account information.</li>
			<li><strong>Webmail:</strong> Click on your profile icon or settings in the webmail interface to view the email address currently in use.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>3. Check the Inbox for Correct Content:</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Look for Expected Emails:</strong> Ensure that the emails you receive are from relevant sources (e.g., school announcements, course updates) and that you have access to the expected messages.
		</p>

		<h2>4. Sign Out and Sign In:</h2>
		<p>
			Sign out of your current email account and then sign in again using the correct credentials to make sure you&apos;re accessing the right account.
		</p>

		<h2>5. Check Account Name or Profile:</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Email Signature:</strong> Often, the email signature or profile name will include the correct email address or identifying information.
		</p>
